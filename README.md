# Examensarbetet
This is a project developed together with Broccoli Engineering AB for a bachelor thesis in Chalmers University of Technology.

The aim of the project is to create a system where the user feeds data to a database which uses machine learning algorithms to predict future sales.
The project includes all parts, from a scale to save data to the database, to developing the ML algorithm to creating a web interface for an overview of the data.

The Application is developed for a 7" touchscreen and is run on a Raspberry Pi connected to the screen. 
The RPi is also connected to a scale through a RS232-serial cable for processing of the data.
The web-server is developed in Django.
The database is based on MySQL.
